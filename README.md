# LSTM Model for Predicting the Next Word

Welcome to the **Next Word Prediction Model** repository! This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the next word in a sequence of text. The model is designed to enhance text-based applications, such as chatbots, autocomplete systems, and text editors.

## 📌 Features

- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Built using LSTM layers for effective sequence modeling.
- **Training with Large Datasets**: Trained on large text corpora to ensure high accuracy.
- **Customizable**: Easily retrainable with your own dataset.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Optimized for quick and efficient word prediction.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the model:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas nltk
```

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lstm-next-word-prediction.git
cd lstm-next-word-prediction
```

### Dataset Preparation

1. Provide a text dataset for training (e.g., books, articles, or conversations).
2. Place the dataset file in the `data/` folder and name it `dataset.txt`.
3. The preprocessing script will tokenize and prepare the text for training.

### Model Training

Train the LSTM model by running:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script will:
- Preprocess the dataset
- Train the LSTM model
- Save the trained model in the `model/` directory

### Predicting the Next Word

After training, use the model to predict the next word in a sequence:

```bash
python predict_next_word.py "The quick brown"
```

Example output:
```
Predicted next word: fox
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenizes the input text.
   - Creates sequences of words.
   - Converts sequences into numerical format for model training.

2. **LSTM Model**:
   - Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build a sequential LSTM model.
   - Learns word dependencies to predict the next word.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Accepts a string of words as input.
   - Outputs the most probable next word.

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the model using a pre-trained example or your custom-trained model. Use the `predict_next_word.py` script to evaluate real-time predictions.
